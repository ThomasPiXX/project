#### Description:

WYA (Where You Are) is a location-based application that is designed primarily for analytical purposes. When a user logs in to the application, the app accesses their geolocation data through their browser, and this information is then stored in a SQL database along with the time of the user's session. The purpose of collecting this location data is to enable developers to analyze and track the movements of users over time. The data can be used for various analytical purposes, such as understanding patterns of user behavior or optimizing the user experience. While the application may allow users to view their location, its primary purpose is to collect data for analysis rather and research than to enable personal tracking.
